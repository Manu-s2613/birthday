  <p>
    I wish you happiness — real, peaceful happiness.
 ok listen…
happy birthday 🎂🤍

it’s kinda crazy when i think abt it
we’ve known each other for more than a decade now
and yet… we hardly know everything abt each other
we didn’t witness all of each other’s highs
we weren’t always there for the lows either

but somehow…
we’re still here
still texting
still calling
still showing up in small, unexpected ways

and honestly?
that says a lot

every time ur name pops up on my phone
it just brings this random smile on my face
like “oh. it’s him.”
simple. comforting. familiar.

what we have is kinda rare
not loud
not dramatic
not everyday
but steady
like a song u don’t play often
but when u do, it hits just right

we share a special bond
no labels
no explanations
just… there

i hope the journey ahead of u is beautiful
like morning skies that don’t rush
like roads that teach u things
like storms that pass but leave u stronger

may u grow, glow, laugh harder
may life surprise u in good ways
may u find peace in chaos
and chaos in boring days 😌

also don’t forget to enjoy life ok... u r already doing but still
eat well not junk okkk
laugh more
and answer calls sometimes 💀

here’s to more years
more random texts
more “remember when” moments
and more smiles for no reason... smiling  star after all lol....
I wish you success that feels fulfilling,  
    not just impressive to others.
 
    And no matter where life takes you,  
    I hope you never forget how special you are.....
    i wanted mine to be ur last wish for ur year......
