  <h1>LAST CHP OF SCHOOL... NOT OUR FRNDSHIP THO</h1>

  <p>
    ok 10th grade was fully lockdown-coded
we hardly even saw each other irl
but the CHATTING??? insane.

late nights turned into early mornings
sleep schedule? nonexistent 💀

i went through those texts last week
and that’s literally when i got the idea to do this for ur bday
crazy how that happened fr

god alone knows when we actually spoke properly
but yeah… somehow it still counts 😌

then came offline exams
and bro aishu STILL laughs abt this 😭
me falling on the stairs
u turning back, laughing, and just walking away
how MEAN of u actually 💀

then those tiny talks after classes
lowkey underrated moments

ALSO
u STILL haven’t revealed the secret
of the big three written in my slam book
u better do it 😤

and ok… graduation day
we didn’t talk much
not even sure if i clicked a pic with u
but yeah… end of school life

AND THAT was the first time
sir ever complimented me saying i looked good
in text, but STILL counts 😌

yeahhh… 10th grade was a whole era lol
