  <h1>our first hangout</h1>

  <p>
   we met after a long time
felt unreal fr

i introduced joel to u guys
vibes were good
everything felt normal… for a while

until we found out abt u and shivani

ngl… me and dhakshu had predicted this back in 10th itself
so it wasn’t shocking
but it still hit

we were pissed
not coz it was wrong or anything
we knew it was urs and hers personal

but yeah… it kinda made us feel like
maybe our friendship didn’t mean much
and that feeling stayed for a bit
took time to forget it honestly

but now… i’m actually happy
happy that u guys are still together
