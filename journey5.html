  <h1>loudest year</h1>

  <p>
    ok this was THE year.
like the year where most of our memories were made fr

sir became the transport minister 💀
and honestly… everything started there
from “congrats” to wherever tf we are now

omg this was literally the best year of my school life
u sitting right in front of me
us constantly annoying u
pure chaos. peak behaviour 😭

idk how u felt abt everyone teasing us together
even tho it wasn’t true
but now when i think abt it… it’s lowkey funny lol

idk if it was true or not 👀
but yeah… that teasing itself became a memory

and bro vikas STILL hasn’t forgotten that 💀
first thing he asks even now is
“so… how’s ur boy?” 😭😭

ALSO important reminder
u STILL haven’t given me the chocolate
for the friendship band i tied
unacceptable behaviour btw 😌

but ngl… i was actually really happy knowing
u still preserved the gift i gave u

dayummm sir… that one hit 🫶

dance practice.... senior granduation day... annual day....remeber alwin?
there is actually a secret i didnt tell u abt ..... u without knowing put me in a big trouble.... and i had to face tht consequence of it for soooo long....
