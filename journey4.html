  <h1>DRIFTED A LITTLE</h1>

  <p>
    Grade 8-when we came back to the same class after a whole year gap
    we didn’t talk much. like barely.
lowkey strangers. highkey awkward 💀
not many memories from this year tbh
  </p>

  <p>
    BUT plot twist 😭
idk if i ever told u this…
geetha maam literally made me a class spy
 for noise complaints from teachers

she trusted me over everyone else for some reason 💀
coz apparently our class was LOUD loud lol

so yeah… me and nandini were the ones who told her abt ur hand cricket
AND that’s why she changed all our places.... 😭

felt like revealing this secret now coz y’all were always wondering who snitched

not sorry. again. lol 😌
